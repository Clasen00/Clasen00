### Hello there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a highly loaded backend (php 7+) and frontend(vue + ts = ❤) that provides the best user experience in digital retail in Russia
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a more skilled programmer. I spend a lot of time on good programming practices (Donald Knuth "The Art of Computer Programming", for example), algorithms, patterns (Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software), and so on.

- ⚡ Did you know that a single pilots helmet on the new F-35 fighter costs $400,000?✈ Instead of helmet, you can pay this money to me and your company will fly much higher then any F-35 😉
